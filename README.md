# mcm-lter-stream-data
This repository contains a series of scripts and plots summarizing the stream data from the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project record. The goal is to link this repository to the telemetry system installed in the stream gages of the Dry Valleys and automatically update plots to get real-time information on seasonal trends compared to historic averages.

There are two types of scripts contained in this repository. The first are Juypter Lab files that contain the basic script structure that the plots are generated from. The second are Jupyter Lab files that can be downloaded that include code for generating plots comparing any year of the record to the total record, allowing for visual investigation of trends within a specific year.

The scripts contained here were created by Jared Collins
